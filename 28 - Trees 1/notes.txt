TREES : this is a hierarchial data structure, this is not linear, the data is stored in levels

Root 
Branches 
Leaves

Binary Tree : this is a tree in which every node has at max two children

Level : this is the horizontal notation, this also shows the depth of the tree 
Subtree : this are the smaller trees within the major tree, for a binary tree there is left and right sub-tree

* the subtrees of leaf nodes are null

Building tree 

preorder sequence 
node -> left node , right node 
-1 means that its a leaf

example
1,2,4,-1,-1,5,-1,-1,3,-1,6,-1,-1 

1 - 2 - 4 , 5 - null , null 
    3 - null , 6 - null , null


There are three ways to traverse inside a tree

via recursion (DFS)
1. Preorder 
2. Inorder 
3. Postorder

via iteration (BFS)
1. Level order

PREORDER : root , left sub-tree , right-subtree 

INORDER : left sub-tree  , root , right-subtree

POSTORDER : left sub-tree , right sub-tree , root

LEVELORDER : data is printed according to the level of the tree, queue is used for this, FIFO (first in first out) is used
the next line will bve stored inthe queue as the null pointer

HEIGHT OF A TREE 

this is the max distance between the root and the leaf 
it can be calculated in the unit of nodes or edges 

height of tree in nodes = height of tree in edges + 1
