TREES : this is a hierarchial data structure, this is not linear, the data is stored in levels

Root 
Branches 
Leaves

Binary Tree : this is a tree in which every node has at max two children

Level : this is the horizontal notation, this also shows the depth of the tree 
Subtree : this are the smaller trees within the major tree, for a binary tree there is left and right sub-tree

* the subtrees of leaf nodes are null

Building tree 

preorder sequence 
node -> left node , right node 
-1 means that its a leaf

example
1,2,4,-1,-1,5,-1,-1,3,-1,6,-1,-1 

1 - 2 - 4 , 5 - null , null 
    3 - null , 6 - null , null


There are three ways to traverse inside a tree

via recursion
1. Preorder 
2. Inorder 
3. Postorder

via iteration 
1. Level order

PREORDER : root , left sub-tree , right-subtree 

INORDER : left sub-tree  , root , right-subtree

POSTORDER : left sub-tree , right sub-tree , root
