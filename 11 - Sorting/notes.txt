SORTING 

Arranging in an order 

1. Bubble Sort 
2. Selection Sort 
3. Insertion Sort 
4. Counting Sort (Avanced)

BUBBLE SORT (01.java)

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly:
1. Compares adjacent elements
2. Swaps them if they are in the wrong order

This way, bigger elements "bubble up" to the end of the list after each full pass.


{5,4,1,3,2} -> Unsorted 
{1,2,3,4,5} -> Incrasing 
{5,4,3,2,1} -> Decreasing

to perfectly sort a n element array n-1 turns are needed

SELECTION SORT (02.java)

Pick the smallest(from the unsorted), put it at the begining.
there are no unnecessary swaps, smallest is found and then taken to the front of the array

INSERTION SORT (03.java)

pick an element from the unsrted part and place it in the right position in the sorted part 

INBUILT SORT (04.java)

there are inbuilt functions in java for sorting

import java.util.Arrays;
Array.sort(arr)

we can also pass the custom starting and ending index to get partial sorting
Array.sort(arr , si , ei)

the time complexity is O(nlogn)
