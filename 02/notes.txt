JAVA FILES 

the java files are stored with the extention .java

public class first {
    public static void main(String args[]) {

    }
}

this is the boiler plate code in java

To compile the code -> javac [filaname]
To run the compiled code -> java [filename]

OUTPUT IN JAVA 

System.out.print("hello") -> prinitng 
System.out.println("hello") -> printing in new line 
use \n to get a line space where ever required

VARIABLES IN JAVA 

variables are named memory spaces which contain data that can be changes, variables can have different sizes based on the data types
the constants in java are literals

* java is a type sensetive language so data type must be defined

DATA TYPES IN JAVA 

PRIMITIVE 

1. byte - 1 byte [-128 to 127]
2. short - 2 bytes
3. char - 2 bytes
4. boolean - 1 byte
5. int - 4 bytes [-2B - 2B]
6. long - 8 bytes
7. float - 4 bytes
8. double - 8 bytes

NON-PRIMITIVE 

1. String 
2. Array 
3. Class 
4. Object 
5. Interface

COMMENTS IN JAVA 

// use this to write comments

/* for multiple 
line comments */

INPUT IN JAVA 

for getting the input we make an object fromt he Scanner class 

next
nextLine
nextInt
nextByte
nextFloat
nextDouble
nextBoolean
nextShort
nextLong

TYPE CONVERSION 

the java compiler itself converts several types of data, this is the implicit conversion and widening conversion

conversion can happen when 
1. type compatible 
2. destination type > source type 

byte -> short -> int -> float -> long -> double

TYPE CASTING 

this is the explicit conversion and this is done forcefully agains the compiler 
this is the lossy conversion, this is the narrowing conversion

TYPE PROMOTION 

1. java automatically promotes each byte, short, or char operand to int when evealuating the expression
2. if one operand is long, float or double the whole expression is promoted to long, float or double respectively

EXECUTION OF JAVA CODE 

JDK : The JDK is a software development kit used to develop Java applications. It includes everything you need to write, compile, and run Java programs.
JRE : The JRE is a runtime environment used to run Java applications. It does not include tools for development like a compiler.
JVM : The JVM is the engine that runs Java bytecode. It is platform-independent, meaning Java code can run on any system that has a JVM.

source code -> compiler -> byte code -> Java virtual machine (JVM) -> Native code
.java                       .class

the source code is compiled into byte code this is the compilation step 
the byte code is converted into native code, this is the execution step 

java is a portable language as the byte code is machine independent and can be executed on any operating system
