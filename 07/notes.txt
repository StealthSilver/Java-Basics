FUNCTIONS 

returnType name(){
    // body 
    return statement;
}

if the return type of the function is void it needs to return nothing 

Methods are those functions which are a part of a class


FUNCTIONS WITH PARAMETERS

returnType(type param1 , type param2){
    // body 
    return statement;
}

PARAMETERS -> they are the variables that are a part of the function definition 

ARGUMENTS -> they are the variables that are used while calling the function

EXECUTION OF FUNCTION 

the functons take part of the call stack 
the part of memory used by the main function is called the stack frame, all the other functions are stored on the top of the main function in the stack

* java is always call by value by default

the copy of the originbal variable is passed in java so the original value of the variable are not changes 
call by refrence is possible in c++ not in java

there are two kind of methods in java

1. user defined method : defined by the user
2. inbuilt method : provided by java e.g. sqrt() , max()

FUNCTION OVERLOADING 

mutliple functions with the same name but different parameters

the paramets can be different by their data type or by the number of parameters
multiply(int a , int b)
multiply(flaot a , flaot b)
multiply(double a , dluble b)

the overloaded functions do not depend on teh data type of the function byt he data type of the parameters involved 

int sum(){} and float sum(){} they are the same functions

BINARY TO DECIMAL 

0 - 0
1 - 01
2 - 10
3 - 11
4 - 100
5 - 101 
6 - 110 
7 - 111
8 - 1000
9 - 1001
10 - 1010

SCOPE 

Method Scope : you cannot use variables before declaring them

Block Scope : the variable declared inside the block {} can only be used inside the block 

{
    int a = 9;
    
}
a = 5; -> this will give the error

Class Scope : depend upon the access modifier of the class , Public , Private or Protected
