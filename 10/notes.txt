Trapping Rainwater (04.java)
given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining

Corner cases 

1. min no. of bars > 2
2. Assending or descending arrays will store 0 water 

trapped water = (water level - height of bar) * width 
water level = min(maxLeftBoundary , maxRightBoundary)
