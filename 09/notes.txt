ARRAYS IN JAVA

arrays are non-primitive data structures
they are the list of elements of same type stored in a contiguous memory location 

> arrays in JAVA follow zero based indexing 
> the memory locations in array are contageous

array elements :    a , b , c 
memeory addresses : 1001 , 1003 , 1005

arrays are static, the memeory once defined cannot be changed at the runtime

arrays are passed by refrence in the function 

Linear search in array 
> the time complexity - worst case O(n) as there are n operations

Binary Search in array 
> the binary search only works on sorted array, it can be incresing or decreasing

the time complexity of binary search is 

iterations go down by n / 2^k -> k = logn

time taken by binary search < linear search
