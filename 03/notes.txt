OPERATIONS IN JAVA 

operators are the symbols in JAVA which perform different opeartions 

1. Arthematic operators 
2. Relational operators
3. Logical Operators 
4. Bitwise Operators 
5. Assignment operators

ARTHEMATIC OPERATORS 

BINARY ARTHEMATIC OPERATORS
+ -> addition 
- -> substraction
* -> multiplication
/ -> divvision
% -> modulus

UNARY ARTHEMATIC OPERATORS

++ -> increment operator (a = a + 1)
-- -> decrement operator (a = a - 1)

pre increment -> first the value is changed then it is used
++ a 

post increment -> first the value is used then it is changes
a ++

RELATIONAL OPERATORS

== -> equal to
!= -> not equal to 
> -> lesser than 
< -> greater than
>= -> greater than or equal to 
<= -> lesser than or equal to

LOGICAL OPERATORS 

&& -> logical AND 
|| -> logical OR 
! -> logical NOT

ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS

= -> assigned to 
+= -> a = a + 10 
-= -> a = a - 3 
*= -> a = a * 8
/= -> a = a / 4
