OOPS -> Object Oriented Programming

oops is a sytle of writing code 

Classes -> groups / blueprints of the enteties 
classes have attributes (properties) and functions (behaviours)

Objects -> enteties in the real world 

Access Modifiers 

Access Modifier        within class     within package       outside packageby subclass only        outside package

Private                     Y                 N                            N                                N 
Default                     Y                 Y                            N                               N 
Protected                   Y                 Y                            Y                               N
Public                      Y                 Y                           Y                               Y


GETTERS AND SETTERS

get : to return the value 
set: to modify the value 

this : this keyword is used to refer to the current object 


ENCAPTULATION 

encaptulation is defined as the wrapping up of data & methods under a single unit. It also implements data hiding


CONSTRUCTORS 

constructor is a special method which is invoked automatically at the time of object creation 

1. constructors have hte same name as class or structure 
2. constructors dont have a return type (not even void)
3. constructors can only be called once 
4. memeory allocation happens when the constructor is callled

by default java created construcors for the classes if we dont make them but they can't be initialized

Types of constructors 

1. non-parameterised : with no parameter 
2. parameterized : with parameter 

we can create multiple constructors according to the knowledge 

construcors overloading : this is the phenomenon by which objects automatically call the required constructors from all the overloaded construcorswe have created according to the parameters -> this is also called polymorphism

3. copy constructor : by default in C ++ 
transferring all the properties of object 1 in object 2, so object2. =copy of object 1

shallow and deep copy 

shallow -> pass by refrence 
deep -> actual copy

* search lazy copy 

DESTRUCTORS 

special functions that remove the classes nce they are used, they are present in c++ , in java garbage collectors does all this
