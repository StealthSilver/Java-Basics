OOPS -> Object Oriented Programming

oops is a sytle of writing code 

Classes -> groups / blueprints of the enteties 
classes have attributes (properties) and functions (behaviours)

Objects -> enteties in the real world 

Access Modifiers 

Access Modifier        within class     within package       outside packageby subclass only        outside package

Private                     Y                 N                            N                                N 
Default                     Y                 Y                            N                               N

GETTERS AND SETTERS

get : to return the value 
set: to modify the value 

this : this keyword is used to refer to the current object 


ENCAPTULATION 

encaptulation is defined as the wrapping up of data & methods under a single unit. It also implements data hiding


CONSTRUCTORS 

constructor is a special method which is invoked automatically at the time of object creation 

1. constructors have hte same name as class or structure 
2. constructors dont have a return type (not even void)
3. constructors can only be called once 
4. memeory allocation happens when the constructor is callled

y default java created construcors for the classes if we dont make them but they can't be initialized
