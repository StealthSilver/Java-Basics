TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY

the time and space are calculated with respect to the input size

order complexity analysis : parameters : tima and space 

time complexity : amount of time taken by an algorithm wrt the input size, this is not the actual time taken

there can be different time complexities:
time = function(input size)

1. Constant O(1)
2. Log O (logn)
3. Linear O (n)
4. Linear * Log O(nlogn)
5. Quadratic O(n^2)
6. Exponential O(2^n)
7. Factorial O(n!)

there are two ways to calculate time complexities : experimental , theorotical
we always try to find thes worst case time

Big O Notation 
this gives the worst case or the upper bound
