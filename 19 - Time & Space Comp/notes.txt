TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY

the time and space are calculated with respect to the input size

order complexity analysis : parameters : tima and space 

time complexity : amount of time taken by an algorithm wrt the input size, this is not the actual time taken

there can be different time complexities:
time = function(input size)

1. Constant O(1)
2. Log O (logn)
3. Linear O (n)
4. Linear * Log O(nlogn)
5. Quadratic O(n^2)
6. Exponential O(2^n)
7. Factorial O(n!)

there are two ways to calculate time complexities : experimental , theorotical
we always try to find thes worst case time

* Cormenn book 

Big O Notation 
this gives the worst case or the upper bound

if time => an^2 + bn + c 
ignore constants, take largest term
time = f(n^2), therefore time complexity O(n^2)

if time => an^3 + blogn + c
Time => O(n^3)

f(n) = O(g(n))

lim n -> infinity |f(n)| / g(n) < infinity

Big omega Notation

this represents the best case time and the lower bound 

Theta Notation

this represents the average time of all the inputs for the algorithm
