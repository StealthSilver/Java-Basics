TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY

the time and space are calculated with respect to the input size

order complexity analysis : parameters : tima and space 

time complexity : amount of time taken by an algorithm wrt the input size, this is not the actual time taken

there can be different time complexities:

1. Constant
2. Log
3. Linear
4. Linear * Log
5. Quadratic
6. Exponential
7. Factorial
