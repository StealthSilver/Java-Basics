RECURSION

this is present in all the programming languages

* everything that can be done through iteration can be done using recursion and vice - versa

Recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on the solution to a smaller instance of the same problem
there is always a base case in recursion, here we know the value

firstly we come from top to down towards the base case and tehn we return from bottom to up

main -> fun -> fun -> fun -> fun -> main 
        val <- val <-  val <- val <- val

Call stack -> main function stores at the bottom 
then subsequent function calls are made
when we reach the base case then teh function returns and all the function calls in the stack are removed from top to bottom
