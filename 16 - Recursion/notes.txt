RECURSION

this is present in all the programming languages

* everything that can be done through iteration can be done using recursion and vice - versa

Recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on the solution to a smaller instance of the same problem
there is always a base case in recursion, here we know the value

firstly we come from top to down towards the base case and tehn we return from bottom to up

main -> fun -> fun -> fun -> fun -> main 
        val <- val <-  val <- val <- val
